I`ve worked really hard on these codes and would everyone to try running them once! you`ll definitely enjoy :)

        Dim Content As String = 0
        Dim FarRight As String = 0
        Dim Farleft As String = 0

        Console.WriteLine("PLEASE TYPE WATEVER YOU`D LIKE TO AND SEE SOME MAGIC : ")
        Content = Console.ReadLine()

        FarRight = Right(Content, 2)
        Farleft = Left(Content, 2)

        If Len(Content) >= 2 Then
            Console.WriteLine("Here`s your magic : " & Farleft & FarRight)
        Else : Console.WriteLine(" Sorry! you ruined the trick :( ")



        End If
        Console.ReadKey()
