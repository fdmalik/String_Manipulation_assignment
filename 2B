        Dim Content As String = 0
        Dim FarRight As String = 0
        Dim Farleft As String = 0

        Console.WriteLine("PLEASE TYPE WATEVER YOU`D LIKE TO AND SEE SOME MAGIC : ")
        Content = Console.ReadLine()

        FarRight = Right(Content, 2)
        Farleft = Left(Content, 2)

        If Len(Content) >= 2 Then
            Console.WriteLine("Here`s your magic : " & Farleft & FarRight)
        ElseIf Len(Content) < 2 Then
            Console.WriteLine(" Sorry! you ruined the trick :( you can have yous string back::::> " & Content)

        End If
        Console.ReadKey()
