        Dim Primary As String = ""
        Dim Secondary As String = ""
        Dim length As Integer = 0
        Dim LetterOne As Char = ""

        Console.WriteLine("Please type in the sting on which you`d like to see my majical spells working ;) ")
        Primary = Console.ReadLine()

        LetterOne = Left(Primary, 1)
        Secondary = LetterOne

        For length = 1 To Len(Primary) - 1
            If Mid(Primary, length + 1, 1) = LetterOne Then
                Secondary = Secondary & "*"
            Else
                Secondary = Secondary & Mid(Primary, length + 1, 1)
            End If

        Next

        Console.Write("Aabracadabra : " & Secondary)
        Console.ReadKey()
