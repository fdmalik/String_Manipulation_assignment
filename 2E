# String_Manipulation_assignment
I`ve worked really hard on these codes and would everyone to try running them once! you`ll definitely enjoy :)

        Dim AlphaA As String = ""
        Dim BetaLeft As String = ""
        Dim BetaRight As String = ""
        Dim AlphaB As String = ""

        Dim NotsLocation As Integer = 0
        Dim BadsLocation As Integer = 0

        Dim NF As Boolean = False
        Dim BF As Boolean = False


        Console.WriteLine("Let the hunger games begin(kindly enter the string) : ")
        AlphaA = Console.ReadLine()

        

        If InStr(AlphaA, "not") <> 0 Then
            NotsLocation = InStr(AlphaA, "not")
            NF = True
        End If

        If InStr(AlphaA, "bad") <> 0 Then
            BadsLocation = InStr(AlphaA, "bad")
            BF = True
        End If

        If NF = False Or BF = False Then
            Console.WriteLine(" Looks like you dont want the majic to take place? ")
        Else
            BetaLeft = Mid(AlphaA, 1, NotsLocation - 1)
            BetaRight = Mid(AlphaA, BadsLocation + 3, Len(AlphaA))
            AlphaB = BetaLeft & "good" & BetaRight

            Console.WriteLine("And here`s the long awaited result that i worked hours on being processed and show to you within a matter of milliseconds: " & AlphaB)
        End If
