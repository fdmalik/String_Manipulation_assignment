# String_Manipulation_assignment
I`ve worked really hard on these codes and would everyone to try running them once! you`ll definitely enjoy :)

        Console.WriteLine(" And now, for my last trick, i`d like you to eter a string : ")
        StrA = Console.ReadLine
        Console.WriteLine(" kindly enter another string (it`d be better if that string is something different) : ")
        StrB = Console.ReadLine
